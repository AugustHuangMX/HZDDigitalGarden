Suppose firm 2's production level is $q_2$, what $q_1$ maximizes firm 1's profit in the current period?

$$
max_{q_1} q_1(1-q_1-q_2)
$$

$$
q_1 = \frac{1-q_2}{2}
$$

Maximized profit 
$$
\pi = \frac{(1-q_2)^2}{4}
$$


Since $P = 1-Q$, $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}$, $c_{1}=c_{2}=0$

$max{Q(1-Q)} \implies Q^m = \frac{1}{2}, \pi^m = \frac{1}{4}, q_{1}=q_{2}=\frac{1}{3}$

It implies that $(q_{1}^c,q_{2}^c) = \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4} \right)$ can be achieved as an equilibrium outcome through trigger strategies as long as $\delta \geq \frac{9}{17}$

## Green and Porter

There is a testable prediction that price wars should happen after negative demand shocks that could not have been predicted by firms.
