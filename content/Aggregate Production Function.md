Specific example: [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]]

$Y=K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$

Generally, it has combination of: $Y = F(A,K,L,N, H \dots)$

---

Growth in output $Y$ must come from growth in the inputs.

Some notations:

- $Y$: output

**Proximate Causes:**
- $A$: technology - technology progress
- $K$: capital - capital accumulation
- $L$: labor - population growth
- $N$: natural resources -discovery
- $H$: human capital - education

Those factors would lead to economic growth in $Y$.

**Fundamental Causes**
- Institutions eg. property rights 
- Geography eg. international trade 
- Culture: eg. saving/eduction 
- Luck eg. natural resources
