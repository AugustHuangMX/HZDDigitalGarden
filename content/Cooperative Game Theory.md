#Econ/Micro #GameTheory 

The most significant difference between [[Noncooperative Game Theory]] and [[Cooperative Game Theory]] is whether players could make binding contracts. 

It has the assumption that players are able to discuss together, the key problem we want to solve is no longer *what action should I take?* but *how to share the cooperative surplus?*
