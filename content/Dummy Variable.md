叫做虚拟变量，偶尔也叫做“哑变量”，

It is whether 0 or 1.

Why we need to set a baseline group?

It is so called the [[Dummy Variable]] trap. We need to avoid the **perfect co-linearity**. So we have to exclude one of the dummy variables. Different pairs of dummy variables included in the equation imply different benchmark/reference category.

Another way to avoid the perfect co-linearity is to include all the dummy variables but exclude the intercept term.
