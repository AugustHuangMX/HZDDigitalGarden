### Lecture 2: Choice & Preferences 🧐

#### **WARP (Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference)**

- **Definition:** If bundle `x` is chosen when `y` is affordable, then `y` cannot be chosen when `x` is affordable.
    
- **Proof Skill:** Almost always a **proof by contradiction**. Assume WARP is violated and show the logical inconsistency. Find two choice sets where the preference between two items is reversed.
    

#### **Key Preference Definitions**

- **Rationality:** Complete (can always compare any two bundles) AND Transitive (if A ≻ B and B ≻ C, then A ≻ C).
    
- **Continuity:** No "jumps." The set of bundles "at least as good as x" is a **closed set**.
    
- **Monotonicity:** More is better.
    
- **Convexity:** Averages are at least as good as extremes. The utility function is **quasi-concave**.
    
- **Strict Convexity:** Averages are **strictly** better than extremes. Guarantees a **unique** optimal bundle.

### Lecture 3: Consumer Problem & Duality 🛒

#### **How to Solve Problems**

- **UMP (find Marshallian Demand x(p,w)):**
    
    1. **Tangency:** MRS=MU2​MU1​​=p2​p1​​
        
    2. **Budget:** p1​x1​+p2​x2​=w
        
    3. Solve the two equations for x1​ and x2​.
        
- **EMP (find Hicksian Demand h(p,U)):**
    
    1. **Tangency:** MRS=MU2​MU1​​=p2​p1​​ (This condition is the same!)
        
    2. **Utility:** u(x1​,x2​)=U
        
    3. Solve the two equations for x1​ and x2​.
        

#### **Key Proofs to Know**

- **Walras's Law (Prop 4): Proof by Contradiction.**
    
    - Assume the consumer does not spend their whole budget (p⋅x<w).
        
    - By local non-satiation, there must be a better bundle nearby that is still affordable.
        
    - This contradicts that the original choice was optimal.
        
- **Uniqueness of Solution with Strict Convexity (Prop 3): Proof by Contradiction.**
    
    - Assume there are two distinct optimal bundles, `x` and `y`.
        
    - By strict convexity, their average, `z = 0.5x + 0.5y`, must be strictly preferred.
        
    - Since the budget set is convex, `z` is also affordable.
        
    - This contradicts that `x` and `y` were optimal.
        
- **Duality (Prop 15): Proof by Contradiction.**
    
    - **UMP solution ⇒ EMP solution:** Assume UMP solution x∗ is NOT the cheapest way to get utility U∗=u(x∗). Find a cheaper bundle x′. Show that x′ was affordable in the UMP and that a nearby bundle x′′ would have given higher utility, contradicting that x∗ was the UMP solution.
        
    - **EMP solution ⇒ UMP solution:** Assume EMP solution h∗ does NOT maximize utility for budget w∗=p⋅h∗. Find a better bundle x′. Show that a slightly scaled-down bundle x′′ achieves the target utility for a lower cost, contradicting that h∗ was the EMP solution.

### Lecture 4: Expected Utility Theory 🎲

Your only task is to use the axioms to prove simple results.

#### **The Three Axioms**

- **Rationality:** Preferences over lotteries are complete and transitive.
    
- **Continuity:** No "heaven or hell" outcomes. Trade-offs are always possible.
    
- **Independence:** If you prefer lottery `p` to `q`, you also prefer a mix of `p` and `r` to the same mix of `q` and `r`. The `r` part is irrelevant and "cancels out."
    

#### **Key Proof Skill (for Lemma 5)**

The main trick is to **cleverly apply the Independence Axiom.**

- **To prove:** If p≻q, then p≻αp+(1−α)q.
    
- Proof: Start with the premise p≻q. Apply the independence axiom, mixing both sides with the lottery p:
    
    αp+(1−α)p≻αq+(1−α)p.
    
    The left side simplifies to p. The result is proven. This pattern is key.
