Example: Given $X \sim N(1,1)$ and we have to find $P(X \leq -2)$

So we have to standardize it: $Z = \frac{x-1}{1}=-3$

So we search for $P(Z \leq -3)$

NLS may appear in the testing problem. But the emphasis is how to conduct instead of how to estimate/derivation.

What is important is what you have learned. It is a tool.
