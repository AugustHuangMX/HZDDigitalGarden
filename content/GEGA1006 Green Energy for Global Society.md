###  **Slide 1 – Mechanism I: What is a Lithium-ion Battery?**

Hello everyone, my name is Minxing, and I’ll be introducing the mechanism behind lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles today.

So first, what exactly is a lithium-ion battery?

It’s a rechargeable battery that works by moving lithium ions back and forth between two key components — the **anode** and the **cathode**.

Now let’s take a quick look at the main parts of the battery:

- The **anode** is usually made of graphite. It stores lithium ions when the battery is charging.
- The **cathode** is made of a lithium metal oxide, like lithium cobalt oxide or NMC.
- Between them is the **electrolyte**, which is basically a liquid solution that lets lithium ions move.
- And finally, there’s a **separator**, which sits in the middle. It prevents short circuits but still allows ions to pass through.

On the right side of the slide, you can see a simple diagram of how these parts are arranged inside a lithium-ion cell.

###  **Slide 2 – How It Works: Driving and Charging**

Now, let’s talk about how this battery actually works — both when the car is driving and when it’s charging.

#### 1. **Driving (Discharging):**

When the car is running, **lithium ions** move from the **anode** to the **cathode** through the electrolyte.

At the same time, **electrons** move through an **external circuit**, from the anode to the cathode. This flow of electrons is what powers the electric motor.

So, in short — the ions move inside the battery, and the electrons move outside, powering the car.

#### 2. **Charging:**

When we charge the battery, the process is reversed.

An external power source, like a charging station, pushes **electrons** from the **cathode** back to the **anode**.

**Lithium ions** follow and move through the electrolyte from cathode to anode. This recharges the battery and stores energy for the next drive.

You can also see a quick comparison between two popular types of lithium batteries:  
**LFP**, which is safer and cheaper, and  
**NMC**, which offers higher energy but may be less stable.

So that’s the basic working principle of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. It’s all about moving lithium ions and electrons in a controlled way to store and release energy.

Thank you — I’ll now hand it over to the next speaker to introduce more about the advantages of the Lithium-ion batteries, and also the disadvantages.
