### 🧱 Slide 1: Two Devices

So first, here’s a quick overview of our two devices:  
**SmartFocus** and **NeuroSense**.

Let’s start with SmartFocus.  
This is a smart alarm clock with a built-in camera and AI.  
Unlike traditional alarms, it doesn’t just ring and stop when you press a button.  
Instead, it uses behavior detection to check whether the user actually gets out of bed.  
If not, it automatically sends reminders or repeats the alarm.  
This is especially helpful for people with ADHD, who often struggle with waking up and easily forget tasks in the morning.

The second product is NeuroSense – a wearable device that monitors stress hormones like cortisol through the skin.  
It connects to a mobile app and provides real-time emotional feedback.  
When stress levels rise, the app might suggest calming actions like breathing or taking a short break.  
Again, this is designed with ADHD users in mind, since they often experience emotional ups and downs and may not realize when they’re getting overwhelmed.

Both of these devices are built around Internet of Things principles – they collect data, process it smartly, and then act or respond in real time to support the user.

### 🔍 Slide 2: SmartFocus – Key Features

Now let’s take a closer look at SmartFocus.

This device does more than just wake you up – it helps guide your morning routine with AI support.  
There are two unique features I’d like to highlight:

The first is **Hyperfocus Detection**.  
People with ADHD sometimes enter a state of deep concentration – we call that hyperfocus.  
While that might sound like a good thing, it can actually cause users to lose track of time or ignore important reminders.  
So SmartFocus uses the camera and AI to detect signs of this, like fixed posture and focused gaze, and chooses not to interrupt when the user is clearly being productive.

The second feature is **Task Breakdown Assistant**.  
A lot of ADHD users get overwhelmed by complex tasks.  
So the AI helps by breaking one big task into smaller, step-by-step actions.  
Here’s a quick example:

Let’s say the user has the task:  
**“Prepare for tomorrow’s presentation.”**  
That would be broken down like this:

1. Open the presentation file
2. Review slides 1 to 5
3. Add missing images
4. Practice speaking for 10 minutes
5. Set an alarm for the next day

This kind of breakdown helps reduce decision overload and lowers the mental barrier to getting started.

Other features include repeating the alarm if the user stays in bed, showing the day’s first task immediately after waking up, and sending notifications to the user’s phone or even to a caregiver if needed.  
All of these features are designed specifically to support the attention, memory, and emotional challenges that ADHD users often face.

非常好的补充！你提到的这点非常关键，也非常贴合 **ADHD 用户的真实需求**，尤其是在服用药物（如**Concerta（专注达）**）时，常常会遇到的问题：


> Now let’s move on to our second device, **NeuroSense**.

NeuroSense is a wearable IoT device designed to help users — especially those with ADHD — monitor their **emotional and physiological state** in real time.

The device uses **skin sensors** to track levels of **cortisol**, a hormone linked to stress.  
This data is analyzed by AI and sent to a connected app, which provides **real-time feedback**, such as breathing suggestions or reminders to take a break.  
This can be very helpful for ADHD users, who often experience emotional ups and downs but may not be fully aware of them.

But NeuroSense goes even further.

ADHD users commonly rely on medications like **Concerta** to manage focus and impulsivity.  
However, they often struggle with **remembering when to take it**, or whether it's already wearing off.  
To address this, NeuroSense also tracks **chemical levels related to stimulant medication** in the body — using sweat-based biosensing.  
When levels drop below an effective threshold, the app can **gently notify the user** that it may be time to take their next dose — or remind them to check in with their doctor if usage patterns seem off.

This allows for **smarter, safer medication management**, especially for students who may be too distracted to self-monitor.

In addition, NeuroSense includes:

- **Hyperfocus Detection**, which avoids interrupting the user when they’re in a rare state of deep productivity
- And a **Task Breakdown Assistant**, which helps break complex goals into smaller, doable steps

> So in short, NeuroSense gives users a clearer window into their body and emotions — and helps them stay regulated, focused, and on track throughout the day.

## ✅ 可选收尾（如果你负责最后一句）

> Together with SmartFocus, this device forms a complete IoT-based support system — one that understands both behavior and biology, and supports ADHD users where they need it most.
