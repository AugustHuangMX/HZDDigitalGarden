#Econ/Macro 

The equation is mainly from the [[Ramsey Model]], trying to figure out the behavior of the R&D sector. (Research and Development).

$$
\frac{\dot{N}}{N} = \theta L_{R}
$$

# Resource Constraint of Labor 

$$
L = L_{Y} + L_{R}
$$

How does a market economy allocate labor across the 2 activities?

When an entrepreneur develops a new product, the entrepreneur becomes a *monopolistic* producing that product.

Let $V$ denote the value of an invention. $\dot{N}$ is the number of new products.

Cost of R&D = $WL_{R}$

We assume free entry into the R&D sector.

$$
\dot{N}V = WL_{R}
$$


$$
PV = \frac{\pi_{i}}{1+r} + \frac{\pi_{i}}{(1+r)^2} \dots = 
$$


Combining two equations, we could get that:

$$
\theta N L_{R} V = W L_{R} \implies \theta N V = W
$$

We will use this equation to determine $L_{R}$
