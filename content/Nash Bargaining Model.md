[[Nash Bargaining Model]] involves [[Threat Values]], [[Cooperative Surplus]] and [[Bargaining Power]]

>  Unlike the initial discussion about the **Noncooperative Game Theory**, the [[Nash Bargaining Model]] is a [[Cooperative Game Theory]] problem.
## The famous example: Prisoner's Dilemma

In the previous study in [[Nash Equilibrium]], we know that the *equilibrium* happens in $(D,D)$ , which is not efficient $(C,C)$ ,that means people act *non-cooperatively*. But we know that in the *Prisoner's Dilemma*, people do so is because they do not have [[Bargaining Power]],if they could, they may reach the better outcome (efficiency).

In this case, the [[Threat Values]] would be $(0,0)$ , the [[Cooperative Surplus]] is $2$. They could reach the efficient outcome by *binding contract* which is $(C,C)$ 

> Binding Contract means no cheating, everyone do as they say.

But this is the case happens when they have *equal bargaining power* , suppose player 1 has full [[Bargaining Power]] but player 2 has none. Then player 1 could ask player 2 to pay $1 or $0.999999 to him, since 0.000001 > -1, player 2 would agree the contract, in this case, player 1 get the full [[Cooperative Surplus]].

The same is in the pollution problem.

Usually in such problems, we follow those steps:

1. What happens in the efficient outcome? (when no rights allocation)
2. What happens without bargaining?
3. What is the [[Cooperative Surplus]]
4. How about the results after bargaining?
5. Provide the results.

## The More formal explanation from [[EC487 Advanced Microeconomics]]

Definition:  A bargaining problem is a tuple $(X,(u^j)^2_{j=1},d)$ where:
- $X \subseteq R^n$ is a *compact* set of outcomes. It could be understood as the possible contracts that two companies could reach.
- $u^1,u^2: X \to \mathbb{R}$ are two continuous utility functions.
- $d\in X$ is a disagreement outcome so that $u^1(x)\geq u^1(d)$ and $u^2(x)\geq u^2(d)$ for all $x\in X$.
