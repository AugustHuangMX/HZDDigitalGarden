$\pi_{R}=\dot{N}V - WL_{R}$

Recall the [[Innovation Equation]]: 

$$
\pi_{R} = \theta N L_{R} V - WL_{R}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \pi_{R}}{\partial L_{R}} = \theta NV - W = 0 \implies \theta NV = W
$$

Exactly same.

The zero-profit condition is equivalent.

The value of an invention: $V = \frac{\pi_{i}}{r}$

We could finally conclude that:

$$
\theta N \frac{\pi_{i}}{r} = W
$$

- We have $\{W,N\pi_{i},r\}$
- $W$ is from *final good* sector.
- $N\pi_{i}$ is from *intermediate goods* sector.
- $r$ is from *households* sector.


## In Final Goods 

$$
Y = L_{Y}^{1-\alpha} \sum_{i=1} X_{i}^\alpha
$$

$$
\pi_{Y} = Y -WL_{Y} - \sum P_{i}X_{i}
$$

FOC: 

$$
W = MPL = \frac{(1-\alpha)Y}{L_{Y}}
$$

$$
P_{i} = MPX_{i} = \alpha L_{Y}^{1-\alpha}X_{i}^{\alpha-1}
$$

## Intermediate Goods 

- Production function: $X_{i} = K_{i}$
- Profit function: $\pi_{i} = P_{i}X_{i} -RK_{i} = (P_{i} - R)X_{i}$

FOC: $P_{i} = \frac{R}{\alpha}\implies R = \alpha P_{i} = \alpha MPX_{i} = \alpha MPK$

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_{i}  & = \left( \frac{R}{\alpha}-R \right)X_{i} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} RX_{i} >0 \\
\pi_{i}  & = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} \frac{RK}{N} \implies N \pi_{i} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}  RK \\
R & = \alpha \frac{\partial Y}{\partial K} = \alpha \alpha    \frac{Y}{K} \\ 
\implies & N \pi_{i} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} \alpha^2 Y = (1-\alpha)\alpha Y
\end{align}
$$

>  Where the interest rate $r$ happens

In order to determine the interest rate $r$, we introduce financial asset, which is the ownership of monopolistic firms. Monopolistic firms generate positive profits, so their shares are financial assets

$$
F = NV
$$

We could also do the [[Hamiltonian]] in this case. 

The non-arbitrage condition.

If $\frac{C}{Y}$ and $\frac{I}{Y}$ are not constant in the Long-run, then either $\frac{C}{Y}$ or $\frac{I}{Y}$ converges to zero:

- $\frac{C}{Y}\to 0 \implies U \to -\infty$
- $\frac{I}{Y} \to 0 \implies K \to 0 \implies Y \to 0$

So $\frac{C}{Y}$ must be constant => $\frac{\dot{C}}{C} = \frac{\dot{Y}}{Y}$ is the long -run
